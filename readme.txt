Enhance your Gravity Forms to include anti-spam measures originally based on the work of David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a non-obtrusive anti-spam measure to all of your Gravity Forms. This measure is originally based on David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

Requires: Gravity Forms v1.5+

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is this plugin PHP7 compatible? =
 
Yes.

= Will this block spam comments or registrations on my site? =

No. For that, we recommend Ben Marshall‘s [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/). Note: As of version 1.5, Ben’s plugin includes support for Gravity Forms; if you install his plugin, you should remove ours.
